
1.The Agent class represents an agent in a transaction network. Here's a breakdown of its components:

identifier represents the unique identifier or name of the agent.
balance represents the current balance of the agent, initially set to 0.0.
transactionHistory is a list that keeps track of all the transactions involving the agent.
The class provides the following methods:

getIdentifier() returns the identifier of the agent.
getBalance() returns the current balance of the agent.
getTransactionHistory() returns the transaction history of the agent.
addTransactionToHistory(Transaction transaction) adds a transaction to the agent's transaction history.
sendTransaction(Agent recipient, double amount) is used to send a transaction to another agent. It checks if the agent has sufficient balance and, if so, deducts the amount from the agent's balance, adds the transaction to the transaction history, and notifies the recipient agent by invoking its receiveTransaction() method. It returns true if the transaction is successful, and false if the agent has insufficient balance.
receiveTransaction(double amount) is invoked by another agent to send a transaction to the current agent. It adds the received amount to the agent's balance.
This class provides the basic functionality for agents to send and receive transactions, maintain their balance, and track their transaction history.

2.The Miner class represents a miner in the blockchain network. Here's a breakdown of its components:

identifier represents the unique identifier or name of the miner.
blockchain is the blockchain object to which the miner belongs.
publicKey and privateKey are the keys used for cryptographic operations.
The class provides the following methods:

getIdentifier() returns the identifier of the miner.
getBlockchain() returns the blockchain object to which the miner belongs.
mine(Transaction transaction) performs the mining process. It takes a transaction as input and attempts to mine a new block by solving the proof-of-work puzzle. It iterates through different nonces until it finds a valid block hash. Once a valid block hash is found, it constructs a new block, adds it to the blockchain, and updates the latest block hash. The mined block is returned.
generateKeyPair() generates a new public-private key pair for the miner using the RSA algorithm.
calculateBlockHash(int nonce, String previousBlockHash, Transaction transaction) calculates the block hash by combining the nonce, previous block hash, and transaction data.
calculateSHA256Hash(String data) calculates the SHA-256 hash of the given data and returns it as a hexadecimal string.
isValidBlockHash(String blockHash) checks if the block hash satisfies the proof-of-work condition. In this case, it checks if the hash starts with "0000".
signSHA256RSA(String input) signs the given input using the private key of the miner using the SHA256withRSA signature algorithm and returns the signature as a Base64-encoded string.
getPublicKey() returns the public key of the miner.
printPublicKey() prints the Base64-encoded string representation of the miner's public key.
This class provides the functionality for a miner to mine blocks, generate key pairs, calculate block hashes, validate block hashes, and perform cryptographic operations using public-private key pairs.

3.The Block class represents a block in the blockchain. It contains the following components:

hash: Represents the hash of the current block.
previousHash: Represents the hash of the previous block in the blockchain.
transaction: Represents the transaction stored in the block.
The class provides the following methods:

getHash(): Returns the hash of the current block.
getPreviousHash(): Returns the hash of the previous block.
getTransaction(): Returns the transaction stored in the block.
getBlockHash(): Returns the hash of the current block (same as getHash() method).
calculateBlockHash(): Calculates the hash of the block by concatenating the previous hash and the transaction data, and then applying the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. The resulting hash is returned as a hexadecimal string.
Please note that the calculateBlockHash() method is private and called internally within the class. It is used to compute the hash of the block when it is constructed.

4.The Blockchain class represents a blockchain, which is a collection of blocks. It contains the following components:

blocks: Represents a list of blocks in the blockchain.
latestBlockHash: Represents the hash of the latest block in the blockchain.
The class provides the following methods:

addBlock(Block block): Adds a new block to the blockchain.
getBlock(int index): Retrieves a block from the blockchain at the specified index.
getSize(): Returns the number of blocks in the blockchain.
getLatestBlockHash(): Returns the hash of the latest block.
setLatestBlockHash(String latestBlockHash): Sets the hash of the latest block.
printBlockchain(): Prints the details of each block in the blockchain, including the block hash, previous block hash, and transaction.
When a new block is added to the blockchain using the addBlock(Block block) method, the block is appended to the blocks list.

The printBlockchain() method iterates over each block in the blocks list and prints its hash, previous block hash, and transaction details.

Overall, the Blockchain class provides functionality to manage and traverse the blockchain, as well as add new blocks to it.

5.The Network class represents a network of agents and miners. It allows simulating transactions and mining operations within the network. Here's an explanation of its components and methods:

agents: Represents a list of agents in the network.
miners: Represents a list of miners in the network.
The class provides the following methods:

addAgent(Agent agent): Adds an agent to the network.
addMiner(Miner miner): Adds a miner to the network.
simulateTransaction(Agent sender, Agent recipient, double amount): Simulates a transaction between a sender and a recipient agent with a specified amount. It checks if the sender has sufficient balance and performs the transaction if possible. It also adds the transaction to the sender's transaction history.
simulateMining(Miner miner, Transaction transaction): Simulates the mining process by a miner. It calls the mine() method of the miner, passing the transaction to be included in the mined block. It also prints information about the miner and the mined block.
printBalances(): Prints the balances of all agents in the network.
printBlockchain(): Prints the details of each block in the blockchain maintained by the miners in the network.
The printBlockchain() method retrieves the blockchain from the first miner in the miners list (assuming all miners have the same blockchain). It then iterates over each block in the blockchain and prints its hash, previous block hash, and transaction details.

Overall, the Network class provides functionality to manage agents and miners in a network, simulate transactions, and print information about balances and the blockchain.

6.The RSA Signature class:
It generates an RSA key pair using the generateKeyPair() method, which initializes a KeyPairGenerator with the RSA algorithm and a key size of 2048 bits. The generated key pair consists of a private key and a public key.
The signMessage() method takes a message and a private key as input. It uses the Signature class to initialize a signature object with the "SHA256withRSA" algorithm, signs the message by updating the signature with the message bytes, and returns the resulting signature as a byte array.
The verifySignature() method takes a message, a signature, and a public key as input. It uses the Signature class to initialize a verifier object with the "SHA256withRSA" algorithm, initializes the verifier with the public key, updates the verifier with the message bytes, and then verifies the signature by passing the signature bytes to the verify() method. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the signature is valid.
In the main() method, a message "Hello, World!" is defined. It generates a key pair using the generateKeyPair() method.
The signMessage() method is called to generate a signature for the message using the private key from the generated key pair.
The verifySignature() method is called to verify the signature using the message, the generated signature, and the public key from the generated key pair.
Finally, the result of the signature verification is printed, indicating whether the signature is valid or not.

7. The Transaction class has the following instance variables:

id: A unique identifier for the transaction, generated using UUID.randomUUID().
sender: The agent who initiated the transaction.
recipient: The agent who is the recipient of the transaction.
amount: The amount of bitcoins being transferred in the transaction.
The constructor of the Transaction class takes three parameters: the sender agent, the recipient agent, and the amount of bitcoins. It assigns a unique ID to the transaction using UUID.randomUUID() and initializes the other instance variables with the provided values.
The getId() method returns the unique identifier of the transaction.
The getSender() method returns the sender agent of the transaction.
The getRecipient() method returns the recipient agent of the transaction.
The getAmount() method returns the amount of bitcoins involved in the transaction.
The toString() method overrides the default toString() implementation to provide a string representation of the transaction. It returns a formatted string that mentions the sender, amount, and recipient of the transaction.
Overall, the Transaction class provides a convenient way to represent and manipulate transactions in the blockchain network.

8.The Main class creates a Network instance, Agent instances (agent1, agent2, agent3), and a Blockchain instance.
The agents are added to the network using the addAgent() method.
Two miners (miner1 and miner2) are created with the blockchain instance and added to the network using the addMiner() method.
A Miner instance (miner) is created to demonstrate printing the public key and is added to the network.
Simulated transactions are performed between the agents using the simulateTransaction() method of the network.
The transaction history of agents is checked to ensure there are transactions before mining.
Mining is simulated by calling the mine() method of miners with the latest transaction from the respective agent's transaction history.
The mined blocks are printed, including the transaction and block hash.
Agent balances and block hashes are printed using the printBalances() and printBlockchain() methods of the network.
Finally, the blockchain is printed using the printBlockchain() method of the blockchain instance.
This code simulates a basic blockchain network where agents perform transactions, miners mine blocks, and the blockchain is printed to display the transaction history and block hashes.
